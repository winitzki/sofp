(2 of 3) Functional programming, chapter 8. Applicative functors and profunctors. Part 2: Theory

Functional programming in the mathematical spirit.

Long and difficult, yet boring explanations given in excruciating detail.

Start by reading the slides, go through the worked examples and exercises. Watch the video when you cannot fully understand something in the slides.

Chapter 8: Applicative functors and profunctors. Part 2: Laws and structure

Portion 2 of 3 covers slides 15 to 17.

Implementing and checking the laws for applicative functor constructions
Examples of applicative functors that disagree with their monad instances
Examples of non-applicative functors
Monoid constructions: why all non-parameterized types are monoids
Why all polynomial functors with monoid coefficients are applicative
Definition and laws of applicative contrafunctors
How applicative contrafunctors are different from applicative functors
