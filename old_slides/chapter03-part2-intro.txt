Functional programming, chapter 3, part 2: Disjunction types

Functional programming in the mathematical spirit.

Long and difficult, yet boring explanations given in excruciating detail.

Start by reading the slides, go through the worked examples and exercises. Watch the video when you cannot fully understand something in the slides.
