Functional programming, chapter 6, part 1: Filterable functors, their laws and structure. Examples

Functional programming in the mathematical spirit.

Long and difficult, yet boring explanations given in excruciating detail.

Start by reading the slides, go through the worked examples and exercises. Watch the video when you cannot fully understand something in the slides.

Chapter 6: Computations in a functor context I. Filterable functors, their laws and structure. Part 1. Examples. Working with filterable functors.

"Functor blocks" (Scala's "for/yield" syntax) and filterable functors
Examples of polynomial filterable functors
Intuitions behind the notion of "filtering" the data in a container
Deriving the filterable functor laws from the intuitions
Examples of functors that are not filterable, and reasons why
Defining the Filterable type class and checking the laws with Scalacheck
Example of a filterable contrafunctor
Worked examples and exercises
