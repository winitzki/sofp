To be sure, a significant part of what engineers do is not covered by any

, the informal reasoning, the traditional knowledge passed on from expert

 Nevertheless, engineering is crucially based on natural science and mathematics

), a new artisan is ready to start productive work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All trades operate entirely from tradition and practical experience.
 It takes a prolonged learning effort to become a good artisan in any profession.
 But the trades do not require academic study because there is no formal
 theory from which to proceed.
 There are no Fourier transforms applied to delta functions, no Lagrangians
 with non-holonomic constraints, no fourth rank tensors to calculate, nor
 any differential equations to solve.

Mechanical, electrical, chemical engineers are required to pass a license

 The license exam certifies that the person is proficient in applying a

 But in software engineering, no certifications or licenses are required
 for the job (although many certification programs exist).

To build large and reliable software, such as new mobile or embedded operating

 Applied functional type theory and functional programming are steps in

Essay: Declarative programming as a silver bullet

The main difficulty of software engineering is that programs tend to grow

) came as one of the features of the Fortran language.
 That feature of Fortran (that still survives in virtually all programming
 languages today) is the math-like syntax for arithmetic expressions.
 With Fortran, for the first time, the programmer could write a formula
 such as 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

A = B * C - SQRT(D)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the computer would generate all the necessary machine codes for computing
 that arithmetical expression.
 Before this innovation, programmers would have to write out all the required
 elementary operations and intermediate results in full, using machine instructi
ons that corresponded to the following sequence of actions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
allocate memory 1 (intended for A)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
allocate memory 2 (intended for B * C)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
put B into memory 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
multiply memory 2 with C and put result into memory 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
allocate memory 3 (intended for SQRT(D))
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
copy register 0 into memory 3 (to save it for later)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
put D into register 0
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
call subroutine SQRT (expecting result again in register 0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
swap register 0 and memory 3 (now restoring old register 0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
flip sign of value in memory 3 (now have -SQRT(D) in memory 3)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
add memory 2 to memory 3 and put result into memory 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
copy memory 2 into register 0
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
free memory 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
free memory 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
free memory 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
return
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of this quite tedious and error-prone sequence of instructions,
 Fortran programmers could simply write 
\begin_inset listings
inline true

\begin_layout Plain Layout

A = B * C - SQRT(D)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The order-of-magnitude productivity increase is obvious from this example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After Fortran, the LISP language enabled programmers to write recursive
 computations on lists and trees quite easily.
 These kinds of computations are important in two areas of computer science:
 compilers and strategy games.
 Implementing a backtracking search without a direct access to recursive
 data structures is a difficult and error-prone task.
 Most programming languages today support recursive data structures and
 recursive functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another innovation was in the Prolog language.
 Prolog implemented a backtracking search as a built-in feature that the
 programmer does not even need to mention explicitly.
 A Prolog program only needs to declare the logical relationships that define
 the search space.
 The program may also specify shortcuts or speedups, to make the backtracking
 search run more efficiently.
 Prolog, however, did not find a lot of use outside the European artificial
 intelligence community of 1970–1980s.
 Its best area of application (expert systems) has had its heyday and is
 now a distant memory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the legacy of Prolog is alive and well in the form of SQL,
 the relational database language.
 SQL simplified Prolog by removing recursion, which made complicated search
 algorithms unnecessary, and instead added various convenience features
 to support table-driven accounting and reporting tasks.
 SQL is still a cornerstone of industrial data processing today.

\begin_layout Standard
Object-oriented programming was initially intended, as in the SIMULA language,
 for simulation of real-time interactions between systems.
 It was thought that people would simply imagine how real-world objects
 interact by sending each other requests or data, and transcribe that picture
 into code.
 Later, it was argued that OOP is especially suitable for developing a powerful
 graphical user interface, called OOUI.

Functional programming languages started with Standard ML, which was a language
 for programming a mathematical proof assistant.
 Languages later developed in the spirit of Standard ML, such as OCaml and
 Haskell, were mostly used for writing compilers and verified code.
 However, basic features of Standard ML — immutable polynomial data types,
 pattern-matching, higher-order functions, and parametric polymorphism with
 a static type inference — have become standard, so that many new languages,
 such as F#, Scala, Swift, and Rust, include them, while older languages
 (Java, C#, Python) have also added some of these features.

 Both languages are claimed up front to be declarative, as opposed to imperative

 It was confusing, however, that two languages that are so different can
 be both deemed declarative.
 It was also clear that Prolog would be quite awkward for, say, numerical
 calculations, while Haskell would require a lot of hard-to-read, imperative
 code for tasks such as downloading a file from a Web server.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

not imperative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and yet that definition is so vague that one could easily claim that Haskell
 is imperative while Visual Basic is declarative.
 Essentially, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

declarative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is understood as a feature of a programming language as a whole, and any
 programming language could be argued to be either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

declarative
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was never satisfied with this definition and kept thinking about this

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The common pattern among all the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

silver bullet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 paradigms is that 1) they were supposed to make programs very concise and
 easily readable when written for a specific and narrowly delineated problem
 domain, 2) they came with a new programming language designed specifically
 for that domain.
 Fortran was designed as a language for numerical mathematics; Prolog as
 a language for rule-based expert systems; and so on.
 One could plausibly argue that Fortran was as well adapted to programming
 numerical expressions as Prolog to expert systems or Haskell to compilers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important consequence is that the same languages were not suitable for
 other problem domains! Prolog was not easily suitable for matrix multiplication
, nor Fortran for expert systems, nor Haskell for GUI programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

declarativeness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not really a property of a programming language, but a 
\emph on
relation
\emph default
 between a programming language and a problem domain.
 A language can be declarative for one specific problem domain but not for
 another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second important consequence is that a program in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

declarative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 language must be something that is clearly understandable to humans.
 For example, the expression 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

A = B * C - SQRT(D)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is unambiguous, and its intent and effect are clear at first sight.
 This is because the program closely resembles what a person would write
 on paper in order to describe the required task.
 Similarly, Prolog programs look like declarations of facts and logical
 relations between facts or properties of some symbols.
 This is again very close to something that a human would write informally
 on paper when describing a particular task or problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an example showing how Prolog is adapted to tasks involving logical

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is the complete code of the Prolog program that solves this
 puzzle, together with an example execution command using SWI-Prolog:
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=bash"
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ cat > martians.pl
\end_layout

We could mechanically rewrite this code and replace Prolog predicates such

declarative programming
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is actually still narrower than a relation between a language and a problem

 Given the same programming language, a program for the same problem domain
 can be written in different ways.
 Some of these equivalent programs will be non-declarative if they do not
 closely resemble a human-readable specification of the task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A programming language is

human-readable specification

Mathematicians have spent millennia developing adequate notation for the

 We do not know if another, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 mathematical notation exists; but the one we have today seems to work well
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each domain where humans have developed sophisticated artifacts, such as
 music, linguistics, technical drafting, and so on, has its own specialized
 notation.
 These notations do not all have the same level of formality or expressivity.
 For instance, the International Phonetic Alphabet

 denotes pronunciation rather precisely, but there seems to be no accepted
 specification language that could denote unambiguously all the richness
 of the expressive intonation people use when actually talking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is safe to say that the task of developing a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 notation — i.e., an unambiguous, expressive, and yet readable specification
 language — for a given problem domain is an extremely difficult task that
 may take a long time for newer problem domains.
 The main reason for the difficulty is that a successful specification language
 must be somehow convenient for human practitioners (whose detailed behavior,
 to date, has evaded a formal description).
 A person reading a description of a task in a good specification language
 must be able to understand the task quickly and should have no further
 questions or ambiguities to clarify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is precisely in areas where the specification language is well understood
 (for example: mathematical formulas, formal grammars, relational logic)
 that the development of a declarative programming language produced an
 order of magnitude increase in productivity.
 In all those cases, the programming language syntactically reproduces the
 specification language and, in this sense, makes the specifications 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

executable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, blind attempts to use the same language for other problem domains
 did not bring any advantages.
 The widely expressed disappointment with structural programming, with OOP,
 or with functional programming is probably due to the fact that people
 expected a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

declarativeness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in one domain to transfer to advantages in all other problem domains.
 But this does not seem to be the case with any of the attempts so far.
 Different problem domains are incompatible and require quite different
 specification languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without an accepted specification language, there is no hope of reaping
 the full benefits of declarative programming.
 One domain where a specification language seems to be currently lacking
 is the visual logic of GUI applications.
 Several approaches — from business process management formalisms to temporal
 logic — have been tried, but so far no consensus emerged that any of those
 notations is truly declarative, — that is, unambiguously expressive and
 at the same time readily understandable to humans.
 When people design GUIs, they communicate their designs to each other informall
y and in multiple stages, gradually resolving the inevitable ambiguities.
 ("And what if I now press this button in that window while the old message
 box is still visible?") As a result, GUI programming remains a difficult
 and error-prone exercise.
 Established GUI environments (X Window, MS Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)
 predominantly use the object-oriented paradigm, which turned out to be
 not a silver bullet for complex GUI design.
 Accordingly, programming a GUI application in these environments is a messy
 and painful affair (I am speaking from first-hand experience).
 Newer developments based on functional reactive programming are more promising
 but yet to be proven declarative, since no adequate specification language
 has emerged as yet in that area.

How to use the silver bullet today: make your own DSL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, many companies (including IBM, Microsoft,
 Sun, Apple, SAP, Bloomberg, and Workday) invented their own programming
 languages adapted to their respective business domains.
 The idea was that a specialized programming language would be necessary
 to serve their specific business.
 I think their intuition was that not merely that existing programming languages
 were not well adapted for business applications, but also that the newly
 designed programming languages would be made declarative for those domains.
 However, those companies most likely did not have a precise definition
 of their specification languages or problem domains before designing their
 new languages, which thus did not necessarily achieve the goal of being
 declarative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you know the specification language of your problem domain, and
 you would like to create a language adapted to that domain, i.e., a domain-specif
ic language (DSL).
 It takes a great deal of work to create and support an entirely new programming
 language.
 The return on the investment is relatively small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A better approach is to implement your DSL as a library in an established
 programming language (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

host
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 language).
 This produces a so-called embedded DSL (EDSL).
 The EDSL does not need to be particularly complicated or extensive.
 Its goal is to fit your problem domain so that you can express specifications
 for your tasks syntactically, more or less as you would tell them to a
 fellow human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The immediate next question is to identify programming languages that allow
 us to easily implement domain-specific languages.
 Several language features seem to be required of a good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

DSL-friendly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 host language.
 One is the ability to redefine the meaning of existing operations, to fit
 the human-readable specification language.
 For example, we might want to redefine (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overload
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) the multiplication operator (
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

*
\end_layout

\end_inset

) so that 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m * n
\end_layout

\end_inset

 would mean the matrix multiplication when 
\begin_inset listings
inline true

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

n
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are matrices.
 C++, Python, Haskell, and Scala support operator overloading, but Java
 and JavaScript do not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful feature would be the ability to make syntax shorter and more
 easily understandable.
 For example, the

\end_inset

 library for Scala defines syntax that allows programmers to write test
 conditions resembling English sentences, such as:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

a + b should be > 0
\end_layout

\end_inset

This code is more easily readable than an equivalent Java syntax:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

(a + b).should().be().greaterThan(0)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another DSL-friendly feature is the ability to generate or transform programs
 at compile time.
 For instance, a database DSL could read the database schema at compile
 time and generate the data access layer code, freeing the programmer from
 the tedious mechanical task of writing and updating the code each time
 the schema is revised.
 If a host language supports these features, a programmer can easily implement
 their own little DSL adapted specifically to the problem domain at hand,
 without modifying the host language's compiler or creating an entirely
 new programming language.

Finally, a DSL is hard to use if it is

brittle

\end_inset

, — that is, permitting users to easily write correct-looking but buggy
 programs.
 The key to assuring correctness is to be able to verify, preferably at
 compile time (but in any case early in the development cycle), that the
 user's DSL program is consistent within the intended meaning of the DSL.
 For instance, if the DSL allows us to multiply matrices by writing 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m * n
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we should not be able to write 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

m * n
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by mistake when 
\begin_inset listings
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

n
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a telephone number rather than a matrix, only to discover the error
 much later when the code is running in production.
 The host language must have a tight control over the abstractions behind
 the DSL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the importance of DSL-friendly features, some programming languages
 are more suitable to building DSLs than others.
 In particular, Scala and Haskell have outstanding abilities to redefine
 syntax, prevent user mistakes, perform compile-time code generation or
 transformation, and hide complexity behind tightly controlled abstractions,
 — all without modifying the existing compiler or tooling.
 For this reason, it is much easier to create custom DSLs in Scala and Haskell
 than in most other programming languages.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Declarative programs are executable specifications.
 Thanks to the development of modern programming languages such as Scala
 and Haskell, the silver bullet is in our hands today.
 Just follow these easy steps and you will slay the software werewolf!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Discover or develop a good specification language for your problem domain.
 The specification language should be unambiguously expressive, complete
 for the problem domain, pragmatically convenient, and yet human-readable.
 It should be obvious at first reading that the specification says exactly
 what we intend to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learn Scala and/or Haskell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement the specification language syntactically as a DSL in a chosen
 host language.
 Iterate on the language as necessary to support your problem domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you have different problem domains in the same project, do not mix different
 DSLs into one uber-language; this has proven to be counterproductive.
 It is best to keep DSLs separate and independent.
