# Applied functional type theory: The science of functional programming

This is a series of in-depth tutorials on functional programming.

The tutorials cover both the theory and the practice of functional programming,
with the goal of building theoretical foundations that are valuable to practitioners.

## Scope of this tutorial series

**Applied functional type theory** (AFTT) is what I call the area of computer science that should serve the needs of functional programmers who are working as software engineers.

It is for these practitioners (I am one myself), rather than for academic researchers,
that I set out to examine the incredible wealth of functional programming inventions over the last 30 years,
-- such as these ["functional pearls" papers](https://wiki.haskell.org/Research_papers/Functional_pearls)
-- and to determine the scope of theoretical material that has demonstrated its pragmatic usefulness and thus belongs to AFTT,
as opposed to material that is purely academic and may be tentatively omitted.

What exactly is the extent of "theory" that a practicing functional programmer should know in order to be effective at writing code?
In my view, this question is not yet resolved.
Once it is resolved, AFTT will be that theory.

Traditional courses of theoretical computer science (algorithms, traditional data structures, complexity theory, formal languages, formal semantics, compiler techniques, databases, networking, operating systems, etc.) are largely not relevant to AFTT.

Here is an example:
To an academic computer scientist, the "science behind Haskell" is the theory of lambda-calculus, the type-theoretic "System Fω", and formal semantics.
These theories guided the design of the Haskell language and define rigorously what a Haskell program "means" in a mathematical sense.

However, a practicing programmer is concerned with _using_ a chosen programming language to _write code_.
A practicing Haskell or Scala programmer is not concerned with designing Haskell or Scala, or with proving general theoretical properties of those languages.

For this reason, neither the theory of lambda-calculus, nor the proofs of type-theoretical properties of "System Fω",
nor theories of formal semantics will actually help a programmer to write code.

So all these theories are not within the scope of AFTT.

As an example of theoretical material that _is_ within the scope of AFTT, consider the equational laws imposed on applicative functors.

An applicative functor is a data structure can specify declaratively a set of operations that do not depend on each other's effects.
Programs can then easily combine these operations, for example, in order to execute them in parallel, or to refactor the program for better maintainability.

To use this functionality, the programmer can begin by designing a data structure that satisfies the laws of applicative functors.
The programmer first writes down the type of that data structure and the code implementing the required methods, and then checks that the laws hold.
The data structure may need to be adjusted in order to fit the definition of an applicative functor or its laws.

This work is done using pen and paper, in a mathematical notation.
Once the applicative laws are verified, the programmer proceeds to write code using that data structure.

Because of the proofs, it is assured that the data structure satisfies the known properties of applicative functors, no matter how the rest of the program is written.
So, for example, it is assured that the relevant effects can be automatically parallelized, as is usual with applicative functors.

In this way, AFTT directly guides the programmer and helps to write correct code.

Applicative functors were discovered by people who were using Haskell for writing code,
in applications such as parser combinators, compilers, or domain-specific languages for parallel computations.

It is important for a practicing functional programmer to be able to recognize and use applicative functors.

Applicative functors are not a feature of Haskell: they are the same in Scala, OCaml, or any other functional programming language.
And yet, no standard computer science textbook explains applicative functors,
motivates their definition and laws, explores their structure, gives examples of applicative functors,
or examples of data structure that are not applicative functors and explains why.
(Neither does any book on category theory or type theory mention applicative functors.)

So far it appears that AFTT should be a mixture of certain areas of category theory, formal logic, and type theory.
However, software engineers would not derive much benefit from following traditional academic courses in these subjects,
because their choice of material is too theoretical and lacks specific results necessary for practical software engineering.
In other words, the traditional academic courses answer questions that academic computer scientists have, not questions that software engineers have.

Existing literature on these theoretical topics tends to be too abstract.

For example, there are now several books intended as presentations of category theory "for computer science" or even "for programmers".
However, all these books fail to give examples vitally relevant to everyday programming, such as applicative or traversable functors.
Instead, these books contain purely theoretical topics such as limits, adjunctions, or toposes, - concepts that have no applications in practical functional programming today.

At the same time, a software engineer hoping to understand the foundations of functional programming will find no mention of the concepts of foldable, filterable, applicative, or traversable functors in any books on category theory, including books intended for programmers.
And yet, these concepts are necessary to obtain a mathematically correct implementation of
such foundationally important operations as `fold`, `filter`, `zip`, and `traverse` -- operations that functional programmers use every day in their code.

To compensate for the lack of AFTT textbooks, programmers have written many online tutorials for each other, trying to explain the theoretical concepts necessary for practical work.
There are the infamous "monad tutorials", but also tutorials about applicative functors, traversable functors, free monads, and so on.
These tutorials tend to be very hands-on and narrow in scope, limited to one or two specific questions and specific applications.
Such tutorials usually do not present a sufficiently broad picture and do not illustrate deeper connections between these mathematical constructions.

For example, "free monads" became popular in the Scala community around 2015.
Many talks about free monads were presented at Scala engineering conferences,
each giving their own slightly different implementation
but never formulating rigorously the required properties for a piece of code to be a valid implementation of the free monad.

Without knowledge of mathematical principles behind free monads, a programmer cannot make sure that a given implementation is correct.
However, books on category theory present free monads in a way that is unsuitable for programming applications (a free monad is an adjoint functor to a forgetful functor into the category of sets).
This definition is too abstract and cannot be used to verify whether a given implementation of the free monad in Scala is correct.

Perhaps the best selection of AFTT tutorial material can be found in the [Haskell wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell).
However, those tutorials are incomplete and limited to explaining the use of Haskell.
Many of them are suitable neither as a first introduction nor as a reference on AFTT.

Apart from referring to some notions from category theory, AFTT also uses some concepts from type theory and formal logic.
However, existing textbooks on type theory and formal logic focus on domain theory and proof theory
-- which is a lot of information that practicing programmers will have difficulty assimilating and yet will have no chance of ever applying in their daily work.
At the same time, these books never mention practical techniques used in many functional programming libraries today,
such as quantified types, types parameterized by type constructors, or partial type-level functions (known as "typeclasses").

Type theory and formal logic can, in principle, help the programmer with certain practical tasks, such as:

- deciding whether two data structures are equivalent as types, and implementing the isomorphism transformation; for example, `(A, Either[B, C])` is equivalent to `Either[(A, B), (A, C)]`
- detecting whether a definition of a recursive type is "valid", i.e. does not lead to a useless infinite recursion; an example of an "invalid" recursive type definition in Scala is `case class Bad(x: Bad)`
- deriving an implementation of a function from its type signature and required laws; for example, deriving the `flatMap` function for the `Reader` monad using the type signature `def flatMap[Z, A, B](r: Z ⇒ A)(f: A ⇒ Z ⇒ B): Z ⇒ B`
- deciding whether a generic pure function with a given signature can be implemented; for example, `def f[A, B]: (A ⇒ B) ⇒ A` cannot be implemented but `def g[A, B]: A ⇒ (B ⇒ A)` can be implemented

I mention these practical tasks as examples because they are perhaps the only real-world-coding applications of domain theory and the Curry-Howard correspondence theory, besides programming language design.
However, existing books on type theory and logic do not give practical recipes for resolving these questions.

On the other hand, books such as ["Scala with Cats"](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/) and ["Functional programming, simplified"](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/functional-programming-simplified-book) are focused on explaining the practical aspects
of programming and do not explain the algebraic laws that the mathematical structures require (such as the laws for applicative or monadic functors).

The only existing Scala-based AFTT textbook aiming at the proper scope is the [Bjarnason-Chiusano book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala), which balances practical considerations with theoretical developments such as algebraic laws.
I intend to continue at about the same level but dig deeper into the foundations and at the same time give a wider range of examples.

This series of tutorial videos is my attempt to delineate the proper scope of AFTT and to develop a rigorous yet clear and approachable presentation of the chosen material.
Eventually I will convert these videos into a new AFTT textbook aimed at practicing functional programmers.
The book will teach programmers how to reason mathematically about types and code, in a way that is directly relevant to practical programming.

### Choice of the programming language

In the videos, I demonstrate code examples in Scala using the IntelliJ editor because this is what I am most familiar with.
However, most of this material will work equally well in Haskell, OCaml, and other FP languages.
This is so because AFTT is not specific to Scala or Haskell, -- a serious user of any other functional programming language will have to face the same questions and struggle with the same practical issues.

The lecture materials (slides and video recordings only) are released into the public domain under a [CC-0 license, which is an "uncopyright"](https://github.com/winitzki/talks/blob/master/LICENSE).

The materials are being written up as a new book, "The Science of Functional Programming", which is released under GNU Free Documentation License.

## Intended audience

The material is presented here at medium to advanced level.
It is not suitable for people unfamiliar with school-level algebra, or for people who are generally allergic to mathematics, or for people unwilling to learn new and difficult concepts through prolonged mental concentration.

The first two chapters are introductory and may be suitable for beginners in programming.
Starting from the middle of chapter 3, the material becomes unsuitable for beginners.

## Main features and goals of this tutorial series

- the presentation is self-contained -- introduces and explains all required notations, concepts, and Scala language features
- an emphasis on clarity and understandability of all explanations, derivations, and code
    - some terminology and notations are non-standard -- this is in order to achieve a clearer and more logically coherent presentation of the material
- an emphasis on the mathematical principles that guide the practice of functional programming
- all mathematical developments are thoroughly motivated by practical programming issues:
    - theory is developed only in order to answer specific questions that arise in programming
    - examples show how each mathematical construction is used for writing code
    - no developing of abstract theory for theory's sake, without having code written as a result, and without answering a question arising from practical coding
    - mathematical generalizations are not pursued beyond either practical usefulness or immediate pedagogical usefulness
- each new concept or technique has sample code and passing unit tests to illustrate its usage and check correctness
    - currently the libraries `curryhoward`, `cats`, and `scalacheck` are used throughout the sample code
- each new concept or technique is fully explained via "worked examples" and drilled via provided exercises
    - answers to exercises are not provided, but it is verified that the exercises are doable and free of errors

It is generally advisable to take a look at the slides and the sample code first, before watching the video.
Watch the video when you cannot follow something shown in the slides, or cannot understand the worked examples or solve the exercises.
This can save you time since the videos are quite long and detailed.

If you do watch the videos, consider adjusting the video speed up to 1.5x; I am a slow speaker.

[YouTube recording: slides + audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cESdgot_ZxY&index=10&list=PLcoadSpY7rHXJWbUkjQ3P9MXBbXxLP8kV)

This optional Addendum to Chapter 3 presents the open-source library `curryhoward` that implements some functions automatically in Scala, given their type signature.

Abstract:

- I implemented a library for compile-time code generation from Scala type signatures. The library uses (compile-time) reflection, the Curry-Howard correspondence, and a theorem prover for the constructive propositional logic. Using this library, I illustrate how the Curry-Howard correspondence maps types into propositions and proofs into code. I will also explain some details of the algorithm I used for automatic code generation from type signatures. As an illustration of using this library for automatic code generation, I demonstrate working examples such as implementing `map` and `flatMap` for the Reader and State monads.

Contents in brief:

- How types are interpreted using propositional logic
- Deriving the code of functions by hand, based on types of those functions
- Using the `curryhoward` library to do the same automatically
- The features of the `curryhoward` library
- How the theorem prover works: the calculus LJ of Gentzen and the calculus LJT of Vorobieff-Hudelmaier-Dyckhoff
- How to interpret the derivation rules for sequents

(But it is not naturally monadic in the way other tree-like monads are.) Download the latest slides for the corrected text.

## Chapter 8, part 1, addendum: Combining `fold` operations

[YouTube recording: live coding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVxCJ3h_Wqs&index=27&list=PLcoadSpY7rHXJWbUkjQ3P9MXBbXxLP8kV)

[Code examples](https://github.com/winitzki/scala-examples/blob/master/chapter08/src/test/scala/example/FoldsPresentation.scala)

The main topic is to illustrate how several `fold` operations can be combined automatically into a single traversal. In Chapter 8, part 1, the central pieces of code were implemented automatically using the `curryhoward` library. This live coding session shows the implementation and explains how it works in more detail.

- Defining a `fold` operation as a data structure and running it afterwards
- Combining several `fold` operations into one
- Implementing the applicative `zip` operation is possible on `fold`s despite `fold` not being a functor
- Adding a final transformation to a `fold`, to make it into a functor
- Implementing a DSL for `fold`s so that running average and standard deviation can be expressed concisely
- Illustrating the difference between applicative and monadic combinators for `fold`s

# Roadmap

0. Cut the scope for the book
1. Finish all videos for that scope
2. Finish writing the book
3. Gather the leftover material for a sequel book devoted to "pragmatics"

The leftover material may include:

- type-level constructions, type-level programming à la `shapeless`, basic usage of dependent types
- design patterns of FP that replace OO design patterns
- functional reactive programming, temporal logic, and UIs
- an example of a full-stack application implemented in Scala with FP patterns
- the following list of functional programming concepts needs to be revisited to select concepts that appear to be both well understood and useful in practice:
    - catamorphisms and other "something-morphisms" (?)
    - comonads and co-applicative functors (?)
    - cofree comonads, cofree functors etc. (?)
    - coroutines, continuations library and "shift/reset programming" (?)
    - zippers / type derivatives (?)
    - lenses / prisms and other "optics", their derivation using profunctor Yoneda (after Milewski)
    - arrows and their relationship to functions (?)
    - Kan extensions, "codensity", other second-order tricks (?)
