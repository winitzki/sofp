# The Science of Functional Programming

This is the official source repository for the new book _The Science of Functional Programming: A tutorial, with examples in Scala_.

<img src="cover/book-draft-cover.png" width="150px" alt="Book cover"/>

The book is a tutorial exposition of the theoretical knowledge that functional programmers need. The material is developed from first principles and contains complete explanations, derivations, and proofs of almost all required results.

So, this is a "transparent" copy in the sense of the GNU license: the source code of the book is in a format that is convenient to use and to modify.

The ["Releases" section](https://github.com/winitzki/sofp/releases) of this repository contains (under "Assets") the full uncorrected draft (`sofp.pdf`)
and the finished and proof-read part of the draft (`sofp-draft.pdf`).
The latest release is
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/winitzki/sofp.svg?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/winitzki/sofp/releases)
and represents the most recent, relatively stable version of the text.

The PDF version of the most recent master branch of the book can be downloaded by following the link to the [PDF builds](https://github.com/winitzki/sofp/actions), clicking on the latest PDF build, and then clicking on "PDF files and LaTeX logs".
Note that you need to be logged in to github in order to download files.

This repository also contains the slides for YouTube presentations that initiated the work on this book.
The talk slides are not part of the book and are partially obsolete both in content and in the notation used.

# Current status of the book

The book is split into three volumes, corresponding to the three parts ranged by difficulty.

Volume 1 (Chapters 1-5) and Volume 2 (Chapters 6-12) are ready. Volume 3 is still in the works.

[Volume 1 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Functional-Programming-Part-tutorial/dp/1471040046/)

[Volume 2 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/144619146X/)

Chapter 13 in Volume 3 remains under construction. It is the last chapter to be written. After that, the book will be ready for general release. 

# Leanpub version of the full draft

The draft version is [available for purchase on leanpub](https://leanpub.com/sofp) for people who want to be notified about updates.

# Printed version of the draft

A printed version of the current draft [can be purchased at lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/sergei-winitzki/the-science-of-functional-programming-draft-version/paperback/product-1y5zzgje.html).

This printed version contains only the chapters whose text has been edited and proofread. It corresponds to the PDF file
`sofp-draft.pdf`  (see the ["Releases / Assets" section of github](https://github.com/winitzki/sofp/releases)).
